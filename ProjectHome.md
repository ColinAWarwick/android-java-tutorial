My mobile contract came up and I bought a new Android phone. But Android Marketplace (now Google Play) lacked a simple iPhone app that I used to use on my old phone. So I despite the fact that I didn't know Java nor Android, I decided to develop it myself and document my adventure here.

All the code is fairly simple so far: just copy and paste it from the wiki tab above.

Hope you find it helpful!
