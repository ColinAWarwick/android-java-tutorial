Ever since Brian Kernighan co-wrote the `hello, world` example in "The C Programming Language" with the author of C -- Dennis Ritchie (whom I once met when I worked in Bell Labs, by the way) -- writing has been about leveraging the libraries of the language and platform in hand. When K&R published the first edition in 1978, a state-of-the-art PDP 11-70 had text terminals so the library call they leveraged was `printf()` from the standard I/O library. They taught us to `#include` the header file, `stdio.h`, and link the library at compile time.
