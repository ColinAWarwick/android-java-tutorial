= Stage Two =
== Google for "java android tutorial" ==

Next, I learnt about the various widgets:

This posting was very helpful on theory but doesn't seem to have many complete examples:

http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/android/java-reflection/

This one has some good examples:

But what I really wanted to do next was to add a hyperlink to a text widget. This one showed me how:

<pre>
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    	TextView theText;
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);

        
    	theText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.Ad);
        linkText = "...buy a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1430231564/309407659021-20'>book about learning Java using Android as an example</a>.";
        theText.setText(Html.fromHtml(linkText));
        theText.setMovementMethod(LinkMovementMethod.getInstance());
    }
</pre>
